Before committing new code or finalizing a feature, ensure the following steps are completed:

1.  **Formatting and Linting:** Run the linter to catch any issues and ensure code consistency.
    ```bash
    npm run lint
    ```
2.  **Testing (Manual):** Run the application locally to ensure that the changes work as expected and have not introduced any regressions.
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
3.  **Build Verification:** Ensure the project builds successfully for production.
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```
